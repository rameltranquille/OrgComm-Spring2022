# Ramel Script 

- Founded in 1886, Johnson & Johnson was branded as a family company, selling maternity kits, medicines, and a many products.
- They were able to sustain this image throughout the most of the 1900s. 
- Unfortunately, after multiple deaths near Chicago were attributed to tampering with Tylenol, JnJ would have to manage their first crisis in 1982
- 30 years later, JnJ's second crisis would see them recalling numerous products such as Benodryl and Motrin, in which metal shavings were found in many products. 
- Just as it was attempting to regain consumer trust, in 2019 it would receive a subpoena claiming that the mineral talc in its baby powder caused cancer,
  which the company was aware of.
- 2020 allowed JnJ another chance to improve their brand image, but were unsucessful after their single dose vaccine was delayed and 
  the CDC conveyed a preference for the Pfizer and Moderna versions of the vaccine in 2021. 
- Today, JnJ has to deal with unresolved issues including litigations and their restructuring, which will see the departure of the consumer-products 
  branch with their most notable brands such as Johnson's Baby powder and Tylenol.
