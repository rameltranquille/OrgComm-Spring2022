- skillset: interpersonal awarenesss, skillful inquiry and ability to quickly teach others.
- thoughtful design in real world teams
- hard problems need cross-disciplinary collaboration

"It's about the courage to be direct and holding high expectations of each other, understanding that uncertainty and risk are part of the work, as is the occasional failure."
