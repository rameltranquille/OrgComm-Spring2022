    - Support two so-called products 
        - OpenPilot (an open-source .........)
        - Comma III DevKit (including the 1st and 2ns generation)
2. Motto - Make Driving Chill
3. George Hotz - Sony + First to Jailbreak iPhone
4. GM Super Cruise and Waymo -> Tesla -> Openpilot
5. Tesla vs OpenPilot
    - Both have 360 degree visibilityy
    - Tesla has sensors, we believe is a source of inefficiency and bugs
    - Ex: Summoning (one of the features comma is missing) bit.ly/3LGowCf
        + "this is a recently paved road...So close yet so far...I never know what its doing"
6. So instead of buying a tesla, you can try the comma III,
